# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 
This project showcases the end-to-end development of a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server**, including robust **ETL pipelines**, clear **dimensional data models**, and practical **SQL-based analytics** for business decision-making.

---

## Data Architecture: Medallion Approach

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, structuring data across three logical layers to ensure quality, reusability, and scalability.


### Bronze -> Silver -> Gold


### Architecture Diagram

- Bronze Layer: Ingests raw ERP and CRM data from CSV files into SQL Server.
- Silver Layer: Performs data cleaning, standardization, and validation.
- Gold Layer: Hosts business-ready data modeled using star schema principles for efficient analysis.

2. **ETL Development**
    - Extraction of raw CSV data
    - SQL-based transformation scripts
    - Multi-layered data pipeline into analytical models

3. **Data Modeling**
    - Fact and dimension tables using a star schema
    - Relationships optimized for analysis and reporting

4. **SQL-Based Analytics**
    - Reports and queries for customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends
